## Key Features

### Timestamps
All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps with automatic triggers.

### Foreign Keys
All relationships are properly defined with `ON DELETE` constraints:
- `CASCADE` - Delete child records when parent is deleted
- `SET NULL` - Clear reference when parent is deleted
- `RESTRICT` - Prevent deletion if children exist

### Indexes
Optimized with indexes on:
- Foreign key columns
- Frequently searched/filtered columns
- Date range queries
- Status fields

### Soft Deletes
Media system includes soft delete support via `deleted_at` field.

### Enums/Constraints
Check constraints enforce data integrity for status fields and other enums.

## Installation

1. Connect to your Supabase project
2. Execute each SQL file in order (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06)
3. Enable RLS (Row Level Security) if needed

## RLS Policies (To be implemented)

For production, implement Row Level Security:
- Users can only see their own profile
- Only admins can delete users
- Users can only edit their own content
- Course content is visible based on enrollment status

## Extensions Required

- `uuid-ossp` - For UUID generation
- `pg_trgm` - For full-text search (optional)
- `pgcrypto` - For cryptographic functions (optional)

## Notes

- All monetary amounts use DECIMAL(12,2) for precision
- Timestamps use `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` for consistency
- JSON fields (JSONB) are used for flexible metadata storage
- Array fields store related values (e.g., tags, technologies)
